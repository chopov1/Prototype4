Initially I set out to create a resource management game inspired by mini motorways. In the end it turned out to be more of a very basic egg game. (egg game is where you hold a button to make chickens and buy upgrades, every idle game ever.) I think making this type of game would have benefited from me creating the economy system first rather then the movement and visuals. I had alot of fun once i was able to make choices be clicking different buttons. The money pop up added an immense amount of "fun factor" to the gameplay atleast for me. If I were to expand on this I think I would need a menu screen, as even with three options there isnt too much room. It would be nice to have descriptions for each upgrade as well. I also love to add some sort of resource managment process, as well as add a bit of singularity to the trains to determine what resource they should transport maybe based on market demand. Obviously would need to cap some upgrades. I think in this game it would be good to start the player out with two options, and as they uograde more, make new options appear so as not to overwhelm them at first and keep things exciting.
